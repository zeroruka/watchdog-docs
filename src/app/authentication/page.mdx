# Registration

Watchdog uses telegram to send you notifications when a new listing is found, so you will need to have a telegram account ready to use this service.

### Step 1

Login to your telegram account and search for `@some_ebay_scraper_bot` and start a chat with it. You have to send a message to the bot, the message can be anything, it doesn't matter.

### Step 2

Visit [Watchdog](http://localhost:5173/) and click on the "Register" button in the top right corner.

### Step 3

Here you will be asked to enter your Username, Telegram Username and Password. The username and password will be used to login to the website, and the telegram username will be used to send you notifications.

- **Username**: This is the username you will use to login to the website.
- **Telegram Username**: This is the username you use to login to telegram. It should start with an `@` symbol, for example `@some_username`, but don't include the `@` symbol here.
- **Password**: This is the password you will use to login to the website.

### Step 4

Once you have filled in the form, click on the "Continue" button. If everything went well, you should be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
