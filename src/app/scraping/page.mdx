## Example use case

In this example, let's say we want to scrape for any listings that matches the search phrase `Malaya Notes`. You would first need to create a new scraper url by clicking on the `Add URL` button on the top right corner of the page.

<Properties>
  <Property name="Name" type="string">
    Any custom name to identify this scraper url. This does not affect the
    scraping process, and is only used when sending a message to you through
    telegram.
  </Property>
  <Property name="Search Phrase" type="string">
    The search phrase to use when scraping for new listings. This is the same as
    how you would normally search in eBay. The URL will be automatically
    constructed based on your search terms. In this example, we will use `Malaya
    Notes`.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Note>
  To make changes to the scraper URLs, you must first stop the scraper. You can
  do this by pressing the `Stop Scraper` button on the top right corner of the
  page.
</Note>

Once you have added a new scraper url, you will see your url appear in the data table below. Now you can press the `Start Scraper` button on the top right corner of the page to start scraping for new listings.

To view all the listings that have been scraped, you can go to the [Results](https://watchdog.zeroruka.moe/dashboard/results/) page. There, you will be able to see all the listings that have been scraped. New listings that appears after you start the scraper will be automatically sent to your telegram account.
