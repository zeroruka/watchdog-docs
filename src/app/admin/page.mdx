# Admin

In this guide, we will delve deeper into the various actions a site admin can perform. This includes managing users, handling site settings, and overseeing system performance. {{ className: 'lead' }}

An admin is defined as the user with the property `admin` set to `true`. An admin user with username of `admin` is created automatically when the server is first initialized. The admin user has access to the admin page, which is accessible at `https://localhost:5173/admin`.

## Control Panel

This page shows the actions that an admin can perform. For now it only has one action, which is to start all scrapers.

When the button is pressed, the server will initialise scrapers of every so that it matches the saved scraper state of each user. This button should only be pressed when the server is restarted, if not, it will cause the scrapers to run twice.

<Note>
  This is a temporary solution to the problem of scraper state. In the future,
  we will have a more robust solution that will allow automatic resumption of
  scrapers when the server is restarted.
</Note>
